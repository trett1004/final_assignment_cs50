# Koy Koy Koy
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
With the application it is possible to create a group with other (registered) users to share information about a purchasing status in that group. The name "Koy Koy Koy" is turkish and can be translated as "Put Put Put". It is derived from a (in Turkey) famous song from the singer Tancu Okan.

The intention is a shared buying list for e.g. a family event. One user puts an item (e.g. milk) in a list. All users being part of the group can see the item (e.g. the milk) and also the purchasestatus (crossed out or not crossed out).
Furthermore submitted entries in that group are stored in a database for future easy access with an autocomplete function.

Aside from that there is a "group"-page where the user can manage his/her groups.
- can see his/hers groups with the corresponding other groupmembers
- add users to groups 
- leave a group.

Further aside from that there is a register and login function.
